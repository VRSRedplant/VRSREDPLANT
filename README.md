I'm Federico,
a passionate and versatile software developer with a solid foundation in Java and Android development, 
complemented by proficiency in multiple programming languages including C#, Python, and C++. 
I began coding at the age of 10, and since then, I've been driven by a curiosity to explore and create innovative solutions.

My journey in software development includes building a fully functional social media app with Google Maps integration using Java, Firebase, and XML.
This project allowed me to delve into user authentication, real-time data synchronization, and designing intuitive interfaces, all while ensuring efficient data management.
